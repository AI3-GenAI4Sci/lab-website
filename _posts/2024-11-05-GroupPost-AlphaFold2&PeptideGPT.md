<!-- excerpt start -->
AF2, the champion of the 2021 CASP competition, is also the work that won the 2024 Nobel Prize and holds significant importance for protein engineering.

PeptideGPT is a pipeline to generate protein sequences with specific functions.

The following is an overview of the presentations by Bohao Lv:

PeptideGPTï¼š
- Finetuned the existing protein sequence generation model ProtGPT2 using protein data with specific functions to generate protein sequences with specific functions.
- Utilized bioinformatics knowledge to perform the first round of sequence rationality screening on the generated sequences.
- Used the structure prediction model ESMFold to perform the second round of rational structure screening on the generated sequences.
- Employed a classifier to validate the functions of the generated protein sequences.
