MAPLEï¼š
- Predicting an individual's age and disease probability through methylation data
- Using contrastive learning methods to eliminate batch effects between methylation data from different sources
- Capturing biological factors related to disease risk using MAPLE
- Analyzing MAPLE results under the framework of aging biology

AF2
- Input feature construction: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) + Pair representation
- Encoding part Evoformer:
  - MSA representation update: seq-based pair-bias self-attention + residues-based self-attention
  - Pair representation update: Triangular multiplicative + Triangular self-attention
